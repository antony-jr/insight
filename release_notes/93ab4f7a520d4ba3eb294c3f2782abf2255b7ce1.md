Check variables while printing

The local variable window frame does not remove inner blocks' variables
when leaving the inner block scope, resulting in trying to display
variables that do not exist anymore, currently causing a segmentation
fault.
Use the checked value printing function to avoid this, resulting in having
these "ghost" variable values displayed as "address of value unknown".
