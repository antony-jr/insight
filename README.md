# insight
 
**Insight** is a graphical user interface to **GDB**, the **GNU Debugger** written in **Tcl/Tk** by people working at **Red Hat, Inc**. and **Cygnus Solutions**. Red Hat has generously **donated** Insight to the **public** and even pays a few people to work on it occasionally.

But one problem exists , Insight is hard to get **now** and a lot of people might want it because **Jeff** exclusively uses it in his
**book** namely **'Assembly Language Step by Step Programming with Linux'** and so did I , Therefore I built an **appimage** for insight and so other folks who stumbles upon the same problem don't want to wreck their head on compiling insight from source.
Infact you **don't even have to install anything** , **Just download a binary and mark it executable**.
